 * # Shape functions
 * 
 * A *shape function* on a reference domain is a basis function used
 * for interpolation on that domain.  We will generally use Lagrange
 * shape functions (also called nodal shape functions), which are one
 * at one nodal point in a reference domain and zero at the others.
 * We want to be able to compute both the values of all shape functions
 * at a point in the domain and also their derivatives (stored as
 * a matris with $d$ columns for a $d$-dimensional reference domain).
 * Our shape function implementations all have the following interface,
 * where the output arguments `N` and `dN` are used to store the
 * shape function values and derivative values.  If a `NULL` is given
 * for either of these output arguments, we just skip that part of the
 * computation.
 * 
 * The function returns the number of shape functions it computes.

 * polynomials ($p = 3)$, as high-order polynomial interpolation
 * through equally-spaced points is poorly behaved.  When finite
 * element codes implement very high order elements, they usually use
 * a non-equispaced mesh (e.g. Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre nodes) that are
 * better behaved for interpolation.
