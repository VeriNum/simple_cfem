# Organization of C files and Rocq files in a program proved with VST

This repository contains a C program proved correct using VST in Rocq.
It is both a program and a proof, and each has its own Makefile.
The organization is as follows:

simple_cfem (root directory, name of git repository)
  - Makefile   (for compiling and linking C program)
  - include   (.h files for C program)
  - src   (.c files)
  - obj  (.o files corresponding to .c files)
  - test  (.c files etc. for unit tests, not necessarily proved correct)
  - exe  (executable files linked from .o files and test files)
  - LAProof (git submodule, should really move into a submodules directory)
  - docs (documentation files, mostly extracted by quarto from .c and .h files)
    - index.qmd  (root of doc files, written by hand)
    - *.qmd  (other qmd files generated from .c, .h files)
    - *.html (generated automatically from .qmd files)
  - gh-pages (git submodule pointing to [gh-pages branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-from-a-branch) of this repo)
    - all files in this directory generated automatically
  - util  (utilities directory)
    - ldoc.lua  (program for extracting .qmd from .c  (?))
  - proof  (root of Rocq proofs)
    - _CoqProject  (listing of .v files including those extracted by clightgen from .c files)
    - Makefile  (standard Makefile that calls upon coq-makefile)
    - CoqMakefile  (automatically generated by coq-makefile)
    - CoqMakefile.local  (contains, among other things, instructions for generating .v files from .c files via clightgen)
    - html (mostly files generated automatically by coqdoc)
      - index.html  (written by hand)
      - (all other files generated automatically)
    - C (Rocq/VST proofs that C programs correctly implement functional models)
      - (no such proofs are yet written, so this directory contains only the clightgen-produced .v files of the C programs)
    - high (Rocq proofs that functional models satisfy high-level specifications)
      - (this directory does not yet exist because no such proofs are written yet)
