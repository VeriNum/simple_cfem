# Introduction

This document is automatically extracted from the sources found
at <https://github.com/VeriNum/simple_cfem>.  The code is written
as a pedagogical example, and is coded in C to make it a reasonable
target for verification with the Verified Software Toolchain.

[The correctness proof is described here](proofdoc/index.html). 

The rest of this page is the C program.
