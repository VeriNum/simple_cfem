# Introduction

This document is automatically extracted from the sources found
at <https://github.com/VeriNum/simple_cfem>.  The code is written
as a pedagogical example, and is coded in C to make it a reasonable
target for verification with the Verified Software Toolchain.

[The correctness proof is described here](proofdoc/index.html). 

The C program is in two parts.  Basic linear algebra functions are in the LAProof library:

 * [`alloc`: Memory allocation](https://verinum.org/LAProof/alloc.html)
 * [`densemat`: Dense matrix operations](https://verinum.org/LAProof/densemat.html)
 * [`bandmat`: Band matrix operations](https://verinum.org/LAProof/bandmat.html)

The rest of this page is the C program.
